        <p>Star is a huge ball of gas held together by gravity. The central core of a star is extremely hot and produces energy. Some of this energy is released as visible light, which makes the star glow.<br></p> <p><em>The most famous Stars are : Polaris, Sirius and Alpha Centauri.</em></p>

            <p> The Polaris aka North Star is the brightest star in the constellation known as the Little Dipper. It is so-called because of the special position it occupies relative to Earth's axis. If you were to stay up all night gazing at the stars, you'd slowly see them revolve around a point in the sky known as the North Celestial Pole.</p>

            <p> Sirius, also called Alpha Canis Majoris or the Dog Star, brightest star in the night sky, with apparent visual magnitude −1.46. It is a binary star in the constellation Canis Major. The bright component of the binary is a blue-white star 25.4 times as luminous as the Sun</p>
